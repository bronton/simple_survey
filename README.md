## Audio Processing

### Audio Recording Process

1. User clicks "Start Recording" button
2. Browser requests permission to access microphone
3. Client sends request to server to create recording
4. Server initiates recording through PortAudio
5. Audio data is buffered in memory
6. When the survey is completed, recording stops
7. Audio is saved in WAV format

### Recording Parameters
- Sample rate: 44100 Hz
- Channels: 1 (mono)
- Bit depth: 16 bit

### File Format
- Container: WAV
- Codec: PCM (uncompressed)
- Approximate size: ~5 MB per minute of recording

## Security

### Security Recommendations

1. **Configuration File Protection**
   - Restrict access to `config.json` (contains SMTP credentials)
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data

2. **HTTPS**
   - Use HTTPS to protect transmitted data
   - Modern browsers require HTTPS for audio recording

3. **Data Storage**
   - Files are stored temporarily and deleted after sending
   - Restrict access to the `uploads` directory

4. **Input Validation**
   - All user data undergoes validation
   - Protection against XSS attacks in templates

### Privacy Policy

It is recommended to develop and provide users with a privacy policy that explains:
- What data is collected
- How audio recording is used
- Data retention periods
- Information protection measures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

#### 1. Microphone Access Error
**Symptom**: Unable to start recording, microphone access error in browser console.

**Solution**:
- Ensure the site uses HTTPS or localhost
- Check browser permissions
- Make sure the microphone is connected and working

#### 2. Email Sending Error
**Symptom**: Survey completes, but email doesn't arrive.

**Solution**:
- Check SMTP settings in configuration
- Ensure SMTP port is not blocked by firewall
- Check application logs for errors

#### 3. "portaudio: not initialized" Error
**Symptom**: Application doesn't start with portaudio error.

**Solution**:
- Ensure PortAudio library is installed
- Check permissions to audio devices
- Restart computer

## Extending Functionality

### Ideas for Further Development

1. **Administrator Authorization**
   - Creating an admin panel
   - Viewing survey statistics

2. **Audio Analytics**
   - Automatic transcription of audio recordings
   - Analysis of speech emotional tone

3. **Additional Question Types**
   - Rating scales
   - Matrix questions
   - File uploads

4. **Integrations**
   - Export data to Google Sheets
   - Integration with CRM systems
   - Webhook for survey events

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How many users can take the survey simultaneously?**  
A: Theoretically there are no limits, but in practice it's recommended to have no more than 50-100 simultaneous users per server with 2GB RAM due to resource consumption during audio recording.

**Q: How long can audio recordings be stored?**  
A: Audio recordings are stored temporarily until sent via email and then deleted from the server. If you need long-term storage, it's recommended to set up email message archiving.

**Q: Which browsers are supported?**  
A: The application supports modern browsers with WebRTC:
- Chrome 49+
- Firefox 52+
- Edge 79+
- Safari 11+
- Opera 36+

**Q: Are mobile devices supported?**  
A: Yes, the application works on mobile devices with WebRTC support.

### Technical Questions

**Q: How to change the maximum recording duration?**  
A: In the current version there is no direct duration limit. Recording continues until explicitly stopped or the survey is completed.

**Q: Can I use a different audio format instead of WAV?**  
A: The current version only uses WAV. Supporting other formats would require code modification in `audio.go`.

**Q: What size ZIP archive can be sent via email?**  
A: This depends on your SMTP server limitations. Most servers have a 10-25 MB limit.
